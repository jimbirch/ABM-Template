# Generic ABM

A jumping off point for building spatially explicit agent-based models for wildlife or fisheries studies. Contains an agent, a spatially explicit environment, and a controller. A graphical display is provided in OpenGL.

By design this code takes no arguments and does nothing. It's for building ABMs.
